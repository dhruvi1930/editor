Code Editor with HTML and CSS Preview

Welcome to my feature-rich code editor application! This platform offers you the convenience of seamlessly adding basic HTML and CSS code while also providing a real-time preview of your work. I've integrated various safeguards to ensure a secure coding environment. 

Key Features:
- Simple HTML and CSS: My application allows you to effortlessly incorporate fundamental HTML and CSS code. 
- Real-time Preview: Witness your code come to life with our dynamic preview feature.
- Enhanced Security: To maintain a safe environment, I've implemented strict validations. For instance, the use of JavaScript `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<iframe>` tags is prohibited. If you attempt to input any disallowed code, an alert will promptly inform you.
- Mobile Responsive: Experience the convenience of my application on the go! My mobile-responsive design ensures smooth usage on mobile devices.

Technology Stack:
This project has been developed using a powerful tech stack to provide you with an outstanding coding experience.
- Frontend Framework: I've harnessed the capabilities of React.js to craft a seamless user interface.
- Server-side Logic: Node.js is at the heart of my application, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
- Type-safe Development: TypeScript has been employed to enhance the reliability and maintainability of our codebase.
- Code Editor Component: The 'react-simple-code-editor' library from npm lends its prowess to our editor, enabling efficient code input.
